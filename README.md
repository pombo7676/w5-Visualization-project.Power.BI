## Overview

The goal of this project was to take into account DATA of an ETL and project it into visualization SW such as Power Bi or Tableau.

In this project I used a Birmanian Supermarket DataBase I found in Kaggle. 

---

## Steps:

1) Find adecuate data for representing several Dashboards in Power BI

2) Filter Data to represent the most valuable information that our supermarket company would need

3) Select these data and represent it with different type of visualizations suitable for each matter or feature

## Dashboards:


* **Examine the data**.

* **Break the project down into different steps** - A hundred simple tasks are` better than a single complicated one

* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of intermediate Python as well as some of the things you've learned in the bootcamp. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!

* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! 

* Think about adding relevant figures to your project each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.

* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version. Name your commits well.

* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want. GIYF.

* **Have fun! Never give up! Be proud of your work!**
