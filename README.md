## Overview

The goal of this project was to take into account DATA of an ETL and project it into visualization SW such as Power Bi or Tableau.

In this project I used a Birmanian Supermarket DataBase I found in Kaggle. 

---

## Steps:

1) Find adecuate data for representing several Dashboards in Power BI

2) Filter Data to represent the most valuable information that our supermarket company would need

3) Select these data and represent it with different type of visualizations suitable for each matter or feature

## Dashboards:


* **1. Relation in between Gender, type of customer and date with location, total amount of income and total count of customers**.
