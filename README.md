## Overview

The goal of this project was to take into account DATA of an ETL and project it into visualization SW such as Power Bi or Tableau.

In this project I used a Birmanian Supermarket DataBase I found in Kaggle. 

---

## Steps:

1) Find adecuate data for representing several Dashboards in Power BI

2) Filter Data to represent the most valuable information that our supermarket company would need

3) Select these data and represent it with different type of visualizations suitable for each matter or feature

## Dashboards:


* **1. Relation in between Gender, type of customer and date with location, total amount of income and total count of customers**.

In the screenshot for the Dashboard shown below I used as filter just Female customers for check which numbers come asociated with this type of client.

* **2. Relation of numbers depending on the product line that is sold in every supermarket**.

In the screenshot for the Dashboard shown below I used as filter the line of products "Fashion Accesories" to check where, when and how much have been sold.
